[M-13-13 Open Data Policy—Managing Information as an Asset](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/) states that agencies *"must apply open licenses, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data, to information as it is collected or created so that if data are made public there are no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, adapting, or otherwise using the information for non-commercial or for commercial purposes"* and notes that *"when information is acquired or accessed by an agency through performance of a contract, appropriate existing clauses shall be utilized to meet these objectives while recognizing that contractors may have proprietary interests in such information, and that protection of such information may be necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply innovative concepts to government programs."*

This section offers examples of contract language that address open licensing and data rights as inspiration for other agencies.

### USAID's [ADS Chapter 579 USAID Development Data](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pbaab096.pdf):

> Contracting Officers (COs) and Agreement Officers (AOs), including those delegated contract and grant-making authority in ADS 103, Delegations of Authority are responsible for incorporating clauses and provisions into contracts, grants, cooperative agreements (CAs), interagency agreements, and other implementing instruments to instruct implementing partners that they must submit Datasets created or collected with USAID funding to the DDL.

### [18F Agile BPA RFQ](https://github.com/18F/ads-bpa/blob/18f-pages/assets/ADS%20RFQ%20Revised%20Modification%205.pdf)

> 15.0 DATA RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP OF DELIVERABLES

> The specific terms and conditions governing data rights and ownership of deliverables shall be
specified in each respective task order under this BPA. The remaining subparagraphs in this
section 15.0 are provided as guidelines for ordering officials to consider incorporating, when
possible and as appropriate, into the ordering official’s task order under this BPA.
It is GSA’s intent that any data or deliverable created as a result of a task order under this BPA
be committed to the public domain.

> Contracting Officers are encouraged to designate in task orders the following items as property
of GSA with the intention of committing the items to the public domain: all data, documents,
graphics and code created under this BPA including but not limited to, plans, reports, schedules,
schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the like; new open source software created by the
Contractor and forks or branches of current open source software where the Contractor has made
a modification; new tooling, scripting configuration management, infrastructure as code, or any
other final changes or edits to successfully deploy or operate the software.

> If commercial software is required as part of the contractor’s delivery of professional services,
then the ordering official shall include the appropriate FAR or applicable agency supplemental
clause(s).

> The contractor shall use open source technologies wherever possible, in support of the 18F
Source Code Policy. All licenses must be expressly listed in the deliverable. Regardless of license(s) used (e.g., MIT, GPL, Creative Commons 0) the license(s) shall be clearly listed in the
documentation.

> If the contractor needs to use work that does not have an open source license, the contractor is
required to request permission from 18F, in writing, before utilizing that work in any way in
connection with the task order. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a conspicuous
place when work is delivered to 18F.

> If an open source license provides implementation guidance, the contractor shall ensure
compliance with that guidance. If implementation guidance is not available, the contractor shall
attach or include the license within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments at
the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a software repository.

> Contracting Officers may consider requiring the contractor to place a copyright waiver on
materials, documents, deliverables, etc., developed during the performance of a task order. See
Attachment D boilerplate template.
