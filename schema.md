This section contains guidance to support the use of the common core metadata to list agency datasets and application programming interfaces (APIs) as hosted at agency.gov/data.

Updates to the metadata schema can be found in the [changelog](/metadata-changelog). Current metadata version: 1.0 FINAL as of 9/20/13.

Standard Metadata Vocabulary
----------------------------
Metadata are selected fields or elements which describe data. The challenge is to define the standard metadata fields and the names of those fields so that the consumer of the data has sufficient information to process and understand the data. The more information that can be conveyed in a standardized regular format, the more valuable data becomes. Metadata can range from basic to advanced, from allowing one to discover the mere fact that a certain data asset exists and is about a general subject all the way to providing detailed semantic information that enables a high degree of machine readability. Making the metadata machine readable greatly increases its openness and utility.

Establishing a common vocabulary is the key to any communication, including communication between machines.  [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) is a hierarchical vocabulary specific to datasets that serves as the basis for the **common core metadata** required in this memorandum. The standard consists of a number of schemas (hierarchical vocabulary terms) that represent things that are most often looked for on the web, with [mappings](http://project-open-data.github.io/metadata-resources/#common_core_required_fields_equivalents) to their equivalents in other standards.  

What to Document -- Datasets and APIs
-------------------------------------

APIs allow developers (both internal to the agency and the public) to dynamically query a dataset. For example, a dataset [of farmers markets](https://explore.data.gov/Agriculture/Farmers-Markets-Geographic-Data/wfna-38ey) may be made available for download as a single file (e.g., a CSV), or may be made available to developers as an API, such that a developer could provide the agency with a ZIP Code, and retrieve a list of farmers markets in that area.

The catalog file should list all of an agency's datasets that can be made public, regardless of form -- this includes raw datasets and APIs.  Use **Endpoint** to indicate which datasets offer dynamic APIs (see below for more information on Common Core and Extensional metadata elements).


Metadata File Format --  JSON
---------------------------------------

The [Implementation Guidance](/implementation-guide/) available as a part of Project Open Data describes Agency requirements for the development of metadata as per the Open Data Policy.  A quick primer on the file format involved:

[JSON](http://www.json.org) is a lightweight data-exchange format that is very easy to read, parse and generate.  Based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, JSON is a text format that is optimized for data interchange.  JSON is built on two structures: (1) a collection of name/value pairs; and (2) an ordered list of values.  

Links to downloadable examples of metadata files developed in this and other formats in [the metadata resources](/metadata-resources/).  Tools to help agencies produce and maintain their data inventories are [available on GitHub](http://www.github.com/project-open-data) and hosted at [Labs.Data.gov](http://labs.data.gov).


"Common Core" Required Fields
-----------------------------
The following "common core" fields are required, to be used to describe each entry:

*(Consult the 'Further Metadata Field Guidance' section lower in the page to learn more about the use of each element, including the range of valid entries where appropriate. Consult the [schema maps](/metadata-resources#common-core-required-fields-equivalents) to find the equivalent Data.gov, RDFa Lite, and CKAN fields.)*

Beyond Common Core -- Extending the Schema
------------------------------------------
"Extensional" and/or domain specific metadata can easily be added using other vocabularies even if it is not a term (entity/property) that will get indexed by the major search engines - it could still be indexed by other custom search engines and by Data.gov.  Agencies are encouraged to extend their metadata descriptions using elements from the "Expanded Fields" list shown below, or from any well-known vocabulary (including Dublin Core, FGDC, ISO 19115, NIEM, and a growing number of vocabularies published at [Vocab.Data.gov](http://vocab.data.gov)) as long as they are properly assigned.

Expanded Fields
---------------
Agencies are encouraged to use the following expanded fields when appropriate. Agencies may freely augment these fields with their own.

**Required** | Yes, always
**Accepted Values** | Must be one of the following: "public", "restricted public", "non-public"
**Usage Notes** | This field refers to degree to which this dataset *could be made available* to the public, regardless of whether it is currently available to the public. For example, if a member of the public can walk into your agency and obtain a dataset, that entry is **public** even if there are no files online. A *restricted public* dataset is one only available under certain conditions or to certain audiences (such as researchers who sign a waiver). A *non-public* dataset is one that could never be made available to the public for privacy, security, or other reasons as determined by your agency.
**Example** | `{"accessLevel":"public"}`

**Usage Notes** | This field should contain one of the following types of content: (1) a bounding coordinate box for the dataset represented in latitude / longitude pairs where the coordinates are specified in decimal degrees and in the order of: minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, maximum latitude; (2) a latitude / longitude pair (in decimal degrees) representing a point where the dataset is relevant; (3) a geographic feature expressed in [Geography Markup Language using the Simple Features Profile](http://www.ogcnetwork.net/gml-sf); or (4) a geographic feature from the [GeoNames database](http://www.geonames.org).
**Example** |  `{"spatial":"Lincoln, Nebraska"}`

{: .table .table-striped}
**Field** | **temporal**
----- | -----
**Cardinality** | (0,1)
**Required** | Yes, if applicable
**Accepted Values** | See Usage Notes
**Usage Notes** | This field should contain an interval of time defined by start and end dates.  Dates should be formatted as pairs of {start datetime/end datetime} in the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. ISO 8601 specifies that datetimes can be formatted in a number of ways, including a simple four-digit year (eg. 2013) to a much more specific YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, where the T specifies a seperator between the date and time and time is expressed in 24 hour notation in the UTC (Zulu) time zone. (e.g., 2011-02-14T12:00:00Z/2013-07-04T19:34:00Z). Use a solidus ("/") to separate start and end times.
**Example** |  `{"temporal":"2000-01-15T00:45:00Z/2010-01-15T00:06:00Z"}`

{: .table .table-striped}
**Field** | **theme**
----- | -----
**Cardinality** | (0,n)
**Required** | No
**Accepted Values** | Array of strings
**Usage Notes** | Separate multiple categories with a comma. Could include [ISO Topic Categories](http://www.isotopicmaps.org/).  
**Example** |  `{"theme":["vegetables","produce"]}`

{: .table .table-striped}
**Field**       | **title**
-----           | -----
**Cardinality** | (1,1)
**Required**    | Yes, always
**Accepted Values** | String
**Usage Notes** | Acronyms should be avoided.
**Example**     | `{"title":"Types of Vegetables"}`

{: .table .table-striped}
**Field** | **webService**
----- | -----
**Cardinality** | (0,1)
**Required** | Yes, if the dataset has an API
**Accepted Values** | String (URL)
**Usage Notes** | This field will serve to delineate the web services offered by an agency and will be used to aggregate cross-government API catalogs.
**Example** | `{"webService":"http://www.agency.gov/vegetables/vegetables.json"}`


Rationale for Metadata Nomenclature
----------------------
We sought to be platform-independent and to align as much as possible with existing open standards.

To that end, our JSON key names are directly drawn from [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/), with a few exceptions.

We added the new **accessLevel** field to help easily sort datasets into our three existing categories: public, restricted public, and non-public. This field means an agency can run a basic filter against its enterprise data catalog to generate a public-facing list of datasets that are, or *could one day be*, made publicly available (or, in the case of restricted data, available under certain conditions). This field also makes it easy for anyone to generate a list of datasets that *could* be made available but have not yet been released by filtering **accessLevel** to *public* and **accessURL** to *blank*.

We added the new **accessLevelComment** field for data stewards to explain how to access restricted public datasets, and for agencies to have a place to record (even if only internally) the reason for not releasing a non-public dataset.

We added the new **systemOfRecords** field for data stewards to optionally link to a relevant System of Records Notice URL. A System of Records is a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual.

We added the new **bureauCode** field to ensure every dataset is connected in a standard way with an agency bureau.

We added the new **programCode** field to ensure that when applicable, every dataset is connected in a standard way with an agency program office.

We added the new **dataQuality** to indicate whether or not the data meets an agency’s Information Quality Guidelines.
