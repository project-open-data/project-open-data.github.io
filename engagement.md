| 1:45 p.m. | Commitments | Emcee |
| 2:15 p.m. | Closing remarks | Person to emphasize the impact of this work |

### Brainstorming Session

#### Define your problem statement

In groups of about 8-10 people (try to include a mix of skills and experience in each group), start with a moderated discussion to define your problem statement in three parts:

1. **Nature:** Your North Star! What is the difference between today and what could be? (One sentence!)
2. **Opportunity:** So what?! What could be better about the world? (One sentence!)
3. **Constraints:** What could get in the way? (Bulleted list)

#### Brainstorm

* **5 min:** In SILENT brainstorming, everyone draws at least three ideas on sticky notes. DRAWINGS are important. Sketch out what your idea should look like.
* **10 min:** PITCH your ideas to your group and then stick them on a board. Try to group similar ideas if possible.
* **5 min:** Silently VOTE on your favorite ideas. Everyone gets 3-5 dot stickers to place on their favorite idea. You can all vote on one idea or spread over many. You can vote for your idea.

#### Refine

* **10 min:** For the top 1-3 most popular ideas, choose a captain for each. Ask participants to form teams around their favorite idea and refine the concept to sketch a (large) one-page pitch that includes:
 * A snappy title!
 * A drawing
 * One sentence explaining the idea
* **Pitch:** Teams present their idea to the entire room. Give teams 3-5 minutes per pitch (less time for bigger rooms).
* **10 min:** Repeat silent voting with dot stickers across the entire room.

At this point, you can ask participants to raise their hand to commit to building initial prototypes for a datapolooza...

## Datapaloozas

### Invitation List

Depending on space, aim high. A recent education datapalooza held more than 600 attendees. In addition to the attendees of any of the data jams, invite other potentially interested administration partners, companies, and press.

## Useful Resources for All Events

### Data brief

This is the document you send in advance of a Data Jam or hackathon to help attendees familiarize themselves with the highlighted data sets and/or APIs. Distribute the doc at the event as well. The brief should contain the following about each highlighted data set or API:

**Title of data set**
www.URLofDataSet.gov
Plain-language, succinct description of what’s in the data set, what’s interesting about the data set, and any special pitfalls to look out for. Also should include an example of how it’s currently being used or could be used.

### Feedback Mechanism

At any of these events, you'll be lucky enough to have technical people thinking about the interesting problems in your subject matter area. Post butcher paper or a white board at the event and ask attendees to add any feedback that comes up during the event. This is specifically designed to capture ideas they have about improving the data sets you're using or data they wish was available -- ask them to add their email address if they’re willing to give more detail in a follow-up. This is great source of ideas for projects that could become datapalooza announcements.
