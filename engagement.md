**For data jams:** Aim for 100 RSVPs, assume 50 will attend. Include approximately 20 policy or subject matter experts, 40 developers and 40 designers.

**For Datapaloozas:** Depending on space, aim high. A recent education datapalooza held more than 600 attendees. In addition to the attendees of any of the data jams, invite other potentially interested administration partners, companies, and press.

**For Hackathons:** Primarily invite designers, developers and other technologists. Decide on capacity based on event space and support staff available.

**Title of data set**
www.URLofDataSet.gov
Plain-language, succinct description of what’s in the data set, what’s interesting about the data set, and any special pitfalls to look out for. Also should include an example of how it’s currently being used or could be used.

## Feedback Mechanism

At any of these events, you'll be lucky enough to have technical people thinking about the interesting problems in your subject matter area. Post butcher paper or a white board at the event and ask attendees to add any feedback that comes up during the event. This is specifically designed to capture ideas they have about improving the data sets you're using or data they wish was available -- ask them to add their email address if they’re willing to give more detail in a follow-up. This is great source of ideas for projects that could become datapalooza announcements.
