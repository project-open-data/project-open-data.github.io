Offsetting collections mean payments to the Government that, by law, are credited directly to expenditure accounts and deducted from gross budget authority and outlays of the expenditure account, rather than added to receipts. Usually, they are authorized to be spent for the purposes of the account without further action by Congress.

The authority to spend offsetting collections is a form of budget authority.
