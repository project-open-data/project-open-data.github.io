## Background

Data is a valuable national resource and a strategic asset to the U.S. Government, its partners, and the public.  Managing this data as an asset and making it available, discoverable, and usable – [in a word, open](principles/) – not only strengthens our democracy and promotes efficiency and effectiveness in government, but also has the potential to create economic opportunity and improve citizens’ quality of life.

For example, when the U.S. Government released weather and GPS data to the public, it fueled an industry that today is valued at tens of billions of dollars per year. Now, weather and mapping tools are ubiquitous and help everyday Americans [navigate their lives](business-case/).

The ultimate value of data can often not be predicted. That’s why the U.S. Government released a [policy](policy-memo/) that instructs agencies to manage their data, and information more generally, as an asset from the start and, wherever possible, release it to the public in a way that makes it open, discoverable, and usable.

The White House developed Project Open Data – this collection of code, tools, and case studies – to help agencies adopt the Open Data Policy and unlock the potential of government data. Project Open Data will evolve over time as a community resource to facilitate broader adoption of open data practices in government. Anyone – government employees, contractors, developers, the general public – can view and contribute. Learn more about [Project Open Data Governance](governance/) and dive right in and help to build a better world through the power of open data. 

The collection of resources below are organized into the following organizational construct to help users navigate through the community resources.

## 5. Open Data Engagement

So you’re opening up government data and making it easier to find and use – to inspire new ideas, spur economic growth, and ultimately make your agency more effective in achieving its mission. But you realize that your agency can’t just supply data – it’s also about getting and acting upon feedback, and catalyzing use of the data from a wide variety of stakeholders.  A community event is a great way to hear ideas and feedback from passionate people, offer your expertise to people with thoughtful questions and evangelize your data assets. This document gives an overview of the main types of open data community events the U.S. Government holds.

#### Open Data Community Events 

5-1 Data Jam - A closed-press, day-long ideation event with developers, designers, and subject matter experts focused on one topic and top related open data sets. Several are held in succession, leading up to a datapalooza three months later. *Ex: Health Data jam (HHS), 21st Century Jobs Jam (OVP, Commerce, OSTP), Mitigating Campus Sexual Assault (Department of Education, Department of Justice)*. **Goal:** To connect tech and policy communities and get commitments to make things with open data, in support of agency mission and priorities.

5-2 Datapalooza - An open press celebration, demo day, and platform to announce government open data releases or improvements. *Ex: Safety Datapalooza (DOT, CPSC, FDA.)*. **Goal:** To celebrate open data tools, companies and commitments and build momentum for projects.

5-3 Hackathon - An event where developers, designers, and strategists work in teams to solve problems with software and/or hardware and demo the resulting work at the end of the day.
*Ex: White House “We The People” API Hackathon, The American Art API Hackathon*. **Goal:** To build relationships with the tech community and to see immediate tools and prototypes.

5-4 [Open Data Community Event Templates and Instructions](engagement/) - Templates based on documents that have been used by agencies from the White House to the Department of Education.

#### Open Data Stakeholder Contacts

5-5 FOIA Officers and Ombudsman - Federal agency staff dedicated to handling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests from industry and media. *[The Office of Government Information Services (OGIS)](https://ogis.archives.gov/) at the National Archives and FOIA staff at agencies.* **Goal:** To monitor and measure the incoming demand for data and proactively release data in response to that signal.

5-6 Chief Data Officers - Federal agency Chief Data Officers. The Chief Data Officer’s role is part data strategist and adviser, part steward for improving data quality, part evangelist for data sharing, part technologist, and part developer of new data products. *See this [growing list of federal Chief Data Officers](chiefdataofficers/).* **Goal:** To engage sister agencies in open data community events. 

5-7 Online Community - A website, social networking group and/or listserv where people who use open data congregate to offer feedback, tips, new uses or reuses, data requests or case studies. *Ex: Listservs for [NICAR](http://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/), [Code for America Brigade](https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forum/#!forum/brigade), [Sunlight Labs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunlightlabs), the Open Government Facebook and Google+ groups.* **Goal:** To build and sustain ongoing relationships with media, nonprofits, good government advocates and civic technologists.
