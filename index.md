#Welcome to the Federal Spending Transparency Collaboration Page 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io)


With the recent enactment of the “Digital Accountability Transparency Act” (DATA Act) [(Pub. L. 113-101)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ101/html/PLAW-113publ101.htm), the Federal Government is working to establish government-wide financial data standards and increase the availability, accuracy, and usefulness of federal spending information. 

Collaboration across the Federal Government and with external stakeholders is critical to the successful implementation of the DATA Act. We would like to use this collaboration space to foster a two way communication and collaboration with both Federal and non-Federal stakeholders.
