How to post events on [Data.gov/events](https://www.data.gov/events)
-----------------------------

Public engagement is key to meaningful open data implementation and a tenant of the Federal Open Data Policy. Whether you are hosting or participating in a [Data Jam, Datapalooza, Hackathon](engagement/) or other event (such as panels or conferences), if it is relevant to government data it should be posted and discoverable on Data.gov. Below are step-by-step instructions detailing how federal employees can post open data community events on Data.gov. 

#### Step 1: Create a Data.gov WordPress account.  
If you've posted a blogpost on Data.gov you should already have one of these! 
  * Register your .gov email at:  https://idm.data.gov/user/register 
  * The Data.gov team will approve you.

#### Step 2. Post an event.
  * Login (in the Footer of Data.gov) or this [link](https://www.data.gov/wp/wp-login.php). 
  * Click on "Events" on the top menu. 
  * Click "Add New" from the menu bar or click this link. 
  * Add your Event! The interface is like posting a blog. 
  * Include as much information as possible (especially the URL announcing your event). Options that you can add include:
		* Event Title o Description o Pictures / Media o Keyword / Tags -- Does your event have a hashtag? 
		* Stare Date & Time 
		* End Date & Time 
		* Location (Address/City/State/Country/Phone) - *a map will appear*
		* Organizer
		* Event Website 
		* Cost (if any)
	* **Pro-tip: Preview before posting!**
