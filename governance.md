### Background
[Project Open Data](/), a new White House resource, is an online collection of code, best practices, and case studies developed to help agencies adopt the framework presented in the memorandum on “Managing Government Information as an Asset to Promote Interoperability and Openness.” Project Open Data will evolve over time as a community resource to facilitate adoption of open data practices. To facilitate collaboration across the Federal Government and in partnership with public developers, the Project is published on the developer social network GitHub. 

As the Project founder, the White House is dedicated to maximizing openness, participation, and collaboration while ensuring the integrity of the resources hosted within the Project. This page provides information on ways to participate in the Project and how the White House will govern it. 

### Participation
Anyone – Federal employees, contractors, developers, the general public – can view and contribute to Project Open Data. (Set up a [GitHub user account](http://www.github.com/users) to get started). Ultimately, the goal is for users to contribute to the project by suggesting changes to code/content (making “[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)”). However, there are many ways to participate:
* Browse. Look around at the different resources available.
* Clone. Copy code/content to your local machine. There is no official record in Project Open Data, and others cannot see what you do with the code/content. 
* Fork. Copy code/content to your own repo in GitHub, and make modifications there. Record of the fork is seen in Project Open Data, and others can see the code/content, but it now resides outsides the Project.
* Comment. Comment on the code/content in Project Open Data using the issue tracker function. Others can see your suggested changes in a public log on Project Open Data. A moderator must accept, modify, or reject the comment in that public log.
* Contribute. Suggest changes to the code/content in Project Open Data by making a pull request. Others can see your suggested changes in a public log on Project Open Data. A moderator must accept, modify, or reject the suggested change in that public log before it becomes a part of the official code/content. 

### Governance
In GitHub parlance, Project Open Data is actually a collection of different little-p “projects” housed in individual repositories, or “repos.” Each individual project repo will be managed as an open source project – i.e., users can make pull requests (suggest changes), and a repo manager will adjudicate the pull requests (accept, modify, or reject) in a public log according to a communicated release cycle (e.g., once a week, every other month). Information on the repo manager and release cycle for updates will be available in each repo’s documentation file. A program management office (PMO) in the General Services Administration (GSA) will delegate management of individual repos on behalf of the White House, as well as provide daily technical oversight and user support for the Project.
* Technical (e.g., source code and applications) and Content (e.g., best practices) – Governance delegated initially to GSA and to additional stakeholders as the project evolves. Federal employees and members of the public can freely submit comments and proposed changes. Frequently updated  by technical and subject-matter experts with little direct policy oversight.
* Policy (e.g., common core metadata schema) – governance held closely by the White House. While federal employees and members of the public may submit comment and proposed change, changes to the official version (the “master branch” in GitHub terms) will be made in accordance with a publicly communicated schedule in consultation with a set of advisory groups that include relevant subject matter experts from across the Federal government. Information on the repo manager and release cycle for updates (including the role of the advisory groups) will be available in each repo’s documentation file. At the onset, this category will include semi-annual review.


### FAQ
**What problem does this solve?**  
Technology moves much faster than policy ever could. Often when writing policy for technology, agencies are stuck with outdated methods as soon as they publish new policies.  

**How does it solve that problem?**  
This Project is meant to be a living document so that collaboration in the open data ecosystem is fostered and the continual update of technology pieces that affect update can happen on a more rapid pace.

**Who can participate in Project Open Data?**  
Anyone – Federal employees, contractors, developers, the general public – can view and contribute to Project Open Data.  

**Who is in charge of Project Open Data?**  
Ultimately? You. While the White House founded and continues to oversee the project, Project Open Data is a collaborative work — commonly known as "open source" — and is supported by the efforts of an entire community. See the "how to contribute" section above to learn more.  

At the onset, the General Services Administration is here to provide daily oversight and support, but over time, it is our vision that contributors both inside and outside of government can be empowered to take on additional leadership roles.  

**Can I use the project's content or source code elsewhere?**
