Press Release Guidance – Don't Forget the Data! 
---------------------------

Increasingly Agency press releases include a data element. Whether you are releasing a report, fact sheet, or special announcement, if there is a data element, you should provide this data as easily discoverable open data. This means linking to your open data in press releases and ensuring this data is as discoverable as possible on Data.gov. 

### Step 1: Release all relevant data as "open data" - that is to say data that is structured, machine-readable, and legally unemcubered to be re-used by anyone. 

### Step 2: Get your data on Data.gov in advance, with complete metadata. 
See [How to Get Your Open Data on Data.gov](http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/) or reach out to your Agency Open Data Policy Point of Contact](points-of-contact/) to ensure your data is listed in your Agency's data.json file. Data.gov updates nightly. 

### Step 3: Hyperlink to Data.gov 

> http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/l8-oli-tirs-landsat-surface-reflectance

If your report contains many datasets, you can tag all of these datasets with a common `keyword` for easier discoverability on Data.gov. You can also embed a list of your relevant datasets in your press release via Data.gov's embed feature.
