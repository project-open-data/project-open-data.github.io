This section offers usable examples of open licenses and public domain dedications for potential use by agencies.

## Generally

Data and content created by government employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to domestic copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. ยง 105. When purchasing data or content from third-party vendors, however care must be taken to ensure the information is not hindered by a restrictive, non-open license.

Agencies should strongly consider making their data entirely license-free, using a worldwide public domain dedication such as [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). See this [guidance on making government data license-free](http://theunitedstates.io/licensing/) for best practices language, examples, and rationale.

When using a license, in general such licenses should comply with [the Open Knowledge definition](http://opendefinition.org/okd/) of an open license.

Several examples of common public domain dedications and open licenses are listed below:
