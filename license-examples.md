This section offers usable examples of open licenses and public domain dedications for potential use by agencies.

## Generally

The open data memorandum, [M-13-13](/policy-memo/), states that federal government data must be open. The "[reusable](/principles/)" principle states that data is open if, at a minimum, it is available under an [open license](/licenses/).

Data and content created by government employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to domestic copyright protection according to 17 U.S.C. ยง 105. These works cannot be openly licensed because they are already in the public domain, at least domestically. International copyright may still apply.

When acquiring data or content from third-parties, however, care must be taken to ensure use of the work by the public is possible and not restricted by a non-open copyright license. While an [open license](/licenses/), as defined by [M-13-13](/policy-memo/), is now a minimum requirement, agencies should strongly consider making this data "license-free," i.e. in the public domain, along with the works created by the agency itself.

A worldwide public domain dedication such as [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) is recommended by a coalition of non-governmental organizations in this [guidance on making government data license-free](http://theunitedstates.io/licensing/), which includes best practices language, real world government examples, and rationale.

When using a license instead, in general such licenses should comply with [the Open Knowledge definition](http://opendefinition.org/okd/) of an open license.

Several examples of common public domain dedications and open licenses are listed below:

## Public Domain Dedications
