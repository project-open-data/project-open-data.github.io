## Current Sources and Definitions

Listed below are the current definitions for this data element that exist across the federal government. These definitions have been formed over years of practice within communities, sometimes involving rulemaking procedures and official public comment. In these cases, there are legitimate and sometime statutory reasons for maintaining variations across communities. For some elements, transparency will be enhanced by adjusting how data are displayed rather than defined. During the next few months, the federal community will continue to explore opportunities to refine and improve the consistent government-wide use of these data definitions, and we will update this page.

## Key Considerations in Providing Feedback

As we continue the process of finalizing these data elements, we want to incorporate public feedback at all points of the process. To facilitate that, the above definitions represent those currently found in federal communities and systems. We encourage you to share your feedback on these existing definitions so that we may fold your insight into our work as we draft proposed definitions – this is an opportunity for you to get involved in the standardization process at an early stage.

Some areas where your input would be especially helpful:

1.  Reconciling FPDS and FAADS+ definitions of Funding Action Obligation
2.  Potential definition on Non-Federal Funding Amount
3.  Other considerations
