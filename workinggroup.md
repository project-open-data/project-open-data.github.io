## Open Data – Data.gov

Responsibly unleash the power of data for the benefit of the American public and maximize the Nation’s return on its investment in data. Data is an asset to be leveraged and strengthen our democracy, promote government efficiencies, and improve citizens’ quality of life when it is made available, discoverable, and usable to the public – in a word, “open”.
