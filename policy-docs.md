## Memos

* Department of the Interior, ["Memo Re: Implementation of DOI Open Data Policy"](/assets/docs/MEMO_RE_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_DOI_OPEN_DATA_POLICY.pdf). This memo served as the official DOI announcement to all Department Bureaus and Offices of the near-term requirements of M-13-13, and also called for the creation of a Data Services Board to oversee data lifecycle management moving forward.
* Department of Health and Human Services, ["The Health Data Initiative Strategy and Execution Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FyKD_JLmFNLKgw5wjJOSn-F84SZi3cdOUg-1LUYFGIA/pub?embedded=true)".  This document, released on October 23, 2013 [on HealthData.gov](http://healthdata.gov/blog/health-data-initiative-strategy-execution-plan-released-and-ready-feedback) serves as the Department's data milestones for 2014-2016.
